  "description": "There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1. You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you must take course bi first if you want to take course ai.\n\nFor example, the pair [0, 1], indicates that to take course 0 you have to first take course 1.\n\nReturn true if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return false.\n\nExample:\n  Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]\n  Output: true\n  Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.",
