  "description": "Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.\n\nYou must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.\n\nExample:\n  Input: nums = [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]\n  Output: 4\n  Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.\n\n  Input: nums = [0, 3, 7, 2, 5, 8, 4, 6, 0, 1]\n  Output: 9",
