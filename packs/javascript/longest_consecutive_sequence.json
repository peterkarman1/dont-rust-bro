  "description": "Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.\n\nYou must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.\n\nExample:\n  Input: nums = [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]\n  Output: 4\n  Explanation: The longest consecutive sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Its length is 4.",
