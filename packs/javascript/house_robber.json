  "description": "You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. The only constraint is that adjacent houses have security systems connected, so you cannot rob two adjacent houses.\n\nGiven an integer array nums representing the amount of money at each house, return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.\n\nExample:\n  Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 1]\n  Output: 4\n  Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and house 3 (money = 3). Total = 1 + 3 = 4.",
