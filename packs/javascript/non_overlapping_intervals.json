  "description": "Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], return the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.\n\nNote that intervals which only touch at a point are non-overlapping. For example, [1, 2] and [2, 3] are non-overlapping.\n\nExample:\n  Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]\n  Output: 1\n  Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest are non-overlapping.",
